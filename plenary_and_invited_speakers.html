        Title: <strong><em>&quot;Modern Nanoelectronics&quot;</em></strong><br />
        <br />
        Time: <em>Thursday, August 13th, 12:00h</em><strong><br />

        Abstract:</strong><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the nanotechnology initiative in the US many countries 
        started a nanoscience program with the result that the number of patent 
        applications with the appendix &#8220;nano&#8221; increased drastically. 
        An analysis of patent families in this field show that nanoelectronics 
        plays an important role. The talk will concentrate on experimental techniques 
        which may be important for nanoelectronic devices supplementing the roadmap 
        in microelectronics.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally accepted, that the scaling law for the 
        miniaturization of microelectronic devices breaks down if the wave nature 
        and the discrete charge of electrons or tunneling phenomena dominate the 
        electronic properties. These quantum phenomena, which are typical for 
        nanodevices, do not mark the end in the miniaturization of devices but 
        open the possibility to create new devices with new functions where for 
        example the energy quantization of electrons in confined structures, tunnel 
        phenomena through barriers and single electron charging of small islands 
        play an important role. The roadmap in nanoelectronics mentions new devices 
        like resonant tunneling diode, single electron transistor, quantum cellular 
        automata or nanotube devices. Up to now it is not clear, whether the top-down 
        process in miniaturization will be successful in nanoelectronics or whether 
        molecular systems and self-organized structures will be combined with 
        standard CMOS technology. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carbon based materials (nanotubes, buckey balls, graphene) 
        seem to be an interesting building block for applications in nanoelectronics 
        and some new developments in this field will be presented. The main part 
        of the talk will discuss the most important technologies for the preparation 
        of semiconductor nanostructures and the new properties of these devices 
        if quantum phenomena become important.<br />

        nanoscopic clusters to supersolids&quot;<br />

        <br />
        Abstract:</strong><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helium clusters are very weakly bound quantum systems, 
        especially interesting because they can be used as cold matrices for molecular 
        spectroscopy and because they serve as microscopic probes of superfuidity. 
        The talk will review some of the progress in the field and give some examples 
        on the studies of stability limits of small quantum clusters performed 
        at the University of Split. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New properties of matter result as a consequence of 
        confinement. Examples will be given for helium adsorbed in carbon nanostructures. 
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the evidence for a &quot;supersolid&quot;, 
        an exotic state of matter that behaves simultaneously as a solid and a 
        friction-free superfluid, will be reviewed.<br />

        Title: <em><strong>&quot;Ultra high energy particles and cosmic ray electrons/positrons, 
        from massive star explosions&quot;<br />
        <br />
        </strong></em>Time:<em><strong> </strong>Sunday, August 16th, 12:00h </em><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Particles near 10^20 eV are the most energetic particles 
        known to us in the Universe, also called ultra high energy cosmic rays. 
        Events have been detected of an energy up to 3x10^20 eV, which is a macroscopic 
        energy. Independently, new components of cosmic ray electrons and positrons 
        have been detected. Here we attribute all of these particles to the acceleration 
        of charged particles in magnetic stellar winds. Considering all of 4*pi 
        around a star with such a wind, over most of 4*pi the magnetic field is 
        nearly tangential, while in the polar cap the magnetic field is radial. 
        This leads for the polar cap component to a flatter spectrum, and also 
        to more interaction. This in turn gives enhanced production of secondary 
        particles such as positrons. The now abundant observations are readily 
        and quantitatively interpreted with the action in magnetic stellar winds. 
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, when two galaxies merge, and their central 
        black holes then also merge, the resulting spin of the final black hole 
        is flipped around: Then a newly oriented relativistic jet can race through 
        a region of a starburst induced as a first stage of the merger, when many 
        massive stars form and explode. This propels the polar cap components 
        of cosmic rays to very much higher energy, while obeying at the same time 
        the Poynting flux limit constraint for active galactic nuclei. This then 
        may explain the Auger data as due to the action of the relativistic jet 
        in the radio galaxy Cen A. Coming from both low energy and high energy, 
        we thus may have a contribution to a coherent and quantitative physical 
        theory for the origin of cosmic rays.<br />

        <strong>About our speaker:</strong> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Peter L. Biermann is retired, and was head of the theory 
        group at the MPI for Radioastronomy in Bonn. He is also professor at the 
        University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany, at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, 
        AL, USA, as well as at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, AL, USA 
        (in all three cases as an adjunct). <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He also works closely with the colleagues in Karlsruhe. His 
        web-page is www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de /div/theory, which outlines the research 
        activities. The group and its scientific activities continue now in a 
        networking mode: this is easy since many of his former academic pupils 
        are now professors, teach at a university or research institution and 
        have their own research groups. This is a worldwide distribution, with 
        about half of them outside Europe. To use a family metaphor, he is scientific 
        great-grandfather already in two countries, and one can expect this to 
        widen and deepen further over time. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Just the 2009 papers from him and his collaborations involve 
        dark matter, primordial black holes, general relativity, galaxy physics, 
        and cosmic ray physics at all energies. His latest paper will soon appear 
        in Physical Review Letters, on cosmic ray electrons and positrons.</p>

        the dragon&#8217;s tail)&quot;<br />

        <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Equatorward of 30&deg; latitude the Earth gains heat from 
        the sun. The most significant manifestation of our climate is the combined 
        atmosphere-ocean circulations transporting energy poleward, balancing 
        the net radiative heating in the equatorial regions. Rates of atmosphere-ocean 
        circulation and their interaction determine our local climates. In this 
        talk I focus on the ocean circulation. In the Atlantic Ocean warm surface 
        waters flow poleward and are converted to cold dense waters in the Arctic 
        Ocean, which then flow equatorward, at depths between one and five kilometres. 
        This is known as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and is sometimes 
        known colloquially as the conveyor belt circulation. One consequence of 
        the MOC is that western Europe has a mild climate for its latitude, influenced 
        at seasonal and longer timescales by the Atlantic ocean circulation. Rapid 
        changes in MOC strength are evident in the historical climate record (particularly 
        during glacial times) and these have a profound impact on climate, locally 
        and globally. Energy transports associated with the equilibrium circulation 
        are modulated by atmosphere-ocean interactions at high latitudes where 
        worryingly ice melt, increasing precipitation, river run-off and heating 
        are acting to reduce the strength of the overturning. State-of-the art 
        coupled climate models suggest a slowing of the MOC by 25% over the next 
        five decades, with a proportional decrease in the northward energy flux. 
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004 we began a novel and ambitious observational programme 
        across the full width of the Atlantic at 26.5&deg;N. Our goal is to continuously 
        measure the strength, structure and energy transport of the MOC providing 
        baseline observations against which future changes may be identified and 
        providing initial conditions for decadal climate forecasts. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that this talk will introduce you to the large-scale 
        ocean circulation, explore one aspect of its interaction with climate, 
        and leave you with an appreciation of important and exciting opportunities 
        in oceanography.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>About our speaker:</strong> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Cunningham&#8217;s personal research interest is the 
        role of oceans in climate. He is a physical oceanographer and specialises 
        in making observations of ocean circulation at sea. He has participated 
        in around thirty scientific research cruises - about 2.5 years at sea 
        over the past fifteen years in the Altantic, Indian, Pacific and Southern 
        Oceans as well as marginal seas like the Mediterranean. He finds seagoing 
        exciting and challenging and most of all he enjoys working with oceanographers 
        from all round the world.</p>

        Title: <em><strong>&quot;A discipline approach to the Bologna reforms: 
        the case of physics&quot;<br />
        <br />
        </strong></em>Time:<em><strong> </strong>Wednesday, August 12th, 12:00h

        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The physics discipline has been quite active in student mobility 
        even before the start of the Bologna process. Indeed a successful &#8217;European 
        Mobility Scheme for Physics Students&#8217; (EMSPS) was established already 
        in 1992 in the frame of the Erasmus programme with the support of the 
        EPS. Hence more than 100 participating institutions gained quite good 
        insight into the structure of the physics studies when organising the 
        student exchanges. A thematic evaluation conference in 1995 gave start 
        to a sustainable network, European Physics Education Network (EUPEN) of 
        more than 100 physics departments in more than 30 countries to co-operate 
        in different projects [EUPEN (1996/2003), STEPS (Stakeholders Tune European 
        Physics Studies)(2005/2008) and STEPS-TWO (2008/2011)] taking along the 
        aims and goals of the Bologna declaration. Close collaboration with the 
        &#8217;Tuning Educational Structures in Europe&#8217; initiatives subject 
        specific competences were developed and &#8217;Reference Points for the 
        Design and Delivery of Degree Programmes in Physics&#8217; were obtained. 
        A recent (2008) investigation by EPS, executed with the help of INCHER, 
        Universit&auml;t Kassel (DE), &#8217;The implementation of the Bologna 
        Process into Physics Studies in Europe&#8217; gave the status of the degree 
        structure in the physics bachelor programmes in more than 150 institutions 
        in some 24 Bologna signatory countries. This project will be continued 
        looking at the masters programmes in 2009 and with the doctorate studies 
        in 2010. Recently a document was drafted &#8217;Specification Description 
        for European Physics Bachelor Studies&#8217; describing the characteristics 
        of the physics study programmes in a European dimension. Results of the 
        preliminary outcomes will be presented in the frame of the follow-up beyond 
        2010.<br />

        Title: <em><strong>&quot;Complex and nonlinear dynamics of charge and 
        spin structures&quot;<br />
        <br />
        </strong></em>Time:<em><strong> </strong>Tuesday, August 11th, 12:00h<strong>

        <br />
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Strong Coulomb interactions are essential for collective 
        electronic states in synthetic conductors and superconductors, e.g. in 
        organic (molecular) as well as in transition metal oxides, which are established 
        in the wide temperature range from 250 K down to lowest attainable temperatures. 
        These states, like charge and spin-density waves, charge orderings of 
        various types and orbital orderings, show rich range of nonlinear properties 
        and complex dynamics which connects them with self organized structures 
        of biological makromolecules - biomaterials. Although biological molecular 
        systems function in water environment at around room temperature, the 
        recently developed understanding indicates that Coulomb interactions are 
        so strong that the diversity of phenomena is comparable to the richness 
        of the low-temperature physics. In this lecture, I will describe the conventional 
        spin density wave phase stabilized in the quasi-one-dimensional organic 
        superconductor [1] and the exotic charge density wave phase formed in 
        the spin ladders of quasi-one-dimensional cuprates [2]; both of them showing 
        complex and nonlinear dynamics in their response to the applied electric 
        fields. At the end I will show how the characterization of complex dynamics 
        displayed by biopolymers, like genomic DNA in aqueous solutions, gives 
        information on their structure and associated biological activity [3].<br />

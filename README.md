# ICPS2009
Website of International Conference of Physics Students 2009

* This is the website that I coded from scratch in PHP for the International Conference of Physics Students in 2009, which I also co-organized. 

* The website successfully managed more than 700 participants, which were able to register for the conference by creating profiles that were securely stored in an SQL database, edit them, and use them to submit abstracts and vote on presentations. 

* The website also had a user-friendly admin part, where the other members of the organizing committee were able to inspect the database statistics, generate abstract lists and various letters in LaTeX / PDF, as well as send automated emails to participants. 

* Live version of the website is available [here](http://www2.fizika.org/icps2009) (if that link is broken, try [this one] (http://phys.columbia.edu/~aficnar/Insight/ICPS2009/))

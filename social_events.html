      <p align="left"> The excursions will take place on Saturday, 15th August, 
        and we offer seven different excursions to choose from. To choose on which 
        excursions you would like to go, please login to your account and at the 
        very bottom you will see a new section where you can choose your first 
        and second choice of excursion. Please make this choice as soon as possible, 
        since the number of seats for most of the excursions is limited and will 
        be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis having in mind your chosen 
        preferences. If you do not choose you excursion preferences online, you 
        will be asked to choose them at the registration desk in Split. Also, 
        some trips have extra charges, which can be paid at the registration desk.<br />
        <br />
        In general, if you would prefer not to go to any of these trips, and would 
        just like to enjoy the beach for the day, we recommend the Ba&#269;vice 
        beach in Split, or any other city beach. Of course, you can go to beach 
        during any free time slots during the conference. However, have in mind 
        that the sun in Split is very strong at this time of the year and we strongly 
        suggest using a sun lotion (factor 30+) whenever you go swimming or on 
        the beach (either on one of our trips or on your own).<br>

        <span class="link"><font size="+2">Zadar</font></span><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadar is a Croatian coastal city, the centre of Zadar 
        county and the wider northern Dalmatian region. Zadar faces the islands 
        of Ugljan and Pa&#353;man, from which it is separated by the narrow Zadar 
        Strait. The promontory on which the old city stands used to be separated 
        from the mainland by a deep moat which has since become a landfill. The 
        harbor, to the north-east of the town, is safe and spacious. Zadar is 
        the seat of a Catholic archbishop.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadar appeared for the first time in history in the 
        4th century B.C. as a settlement of the Illyrian tribe of Liburnians. 
        Today Zadar is a preserved monument of various historical times and cultures 
        that have placed their boundaries and visible outlines of their urban 
        appearance. Zadar is a city rich in spiritual and material culture, as 
        well as in a touristic identity created in the present. It was created 
        around the Roman forum, a city inside well-kept walls, a city of old Croatian 
        monuments.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea organ is an architectural object located in 
        Zadar, and an experimental musical instrument which plays music with the 
        help of sea waves and tubes located underneath a set of large marble steps. 
        The waves create somewhat random but harmonic sounds.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greeting to the Sun consists of three hundred multi-layered 
        glass plates placed on the same level with the stone-paved waterfront 
        in the shape of a 22-meter diameter circle. Under the glass conduction 
        plates there are photo-voltage solar modules through which symbolic communication 
        with nature is made, with the aim to communicate with light, just like 
        the Sea Organs do with sound. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this excursion you will be able to see all monuments 
        and other special sights in Zadar, like Sea organ and Greeting to the 
        Sun. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Extra charge for this trip is 10 &euro;.</strong>

      <p><font size="+2"><span class="linkCopy">&#352;ibenik</span></font><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#352;ibenik (Sebenico) is a historic town in Croatia, 
        population 51,553 (2001). It is located in central Dalmatia where the 
        river Krka flows into the Adriatic Sea. &#352;ibenik is a political, educational, 
        transport, industrial and tourist center of &#352;ibenik-Knin county. 
        &#352;ibenik lies almost in the middle of the Croatian Adriatic Coast, 
        in the picturesque and indented bay around the mouth of the river Krka, 
        one of the most beautiful Karst rivers in Croatia.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#352;ibenik was mentioned for the first time under 
        its present name in 1066 in a Charter of the Croatian King Petar Kre&#353;imir 
        IV who lived in the fortified citadel Sv. Mihovil. For a period of time, 
        it was a seat of the Croatian King. For that reason, &#352;ibenik is also 
        called &quot;Kre&#353;imirov grad&quot; (Kre&#353;imir's city).<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Venetians held &#352;ibenik from 1116 - 1124 and from 
        1125 - 1133. Hungarian-Croatian king Stjepan IV granted it autonomy in 
        1167. After a short period of Byzantine rule to 1180, Croatian kings, 
        Venetia, Bosnian king Stjepan Tvrtko and duke Hrvoje Vuk&#269;i&#263; Hrvatini&#263; 
        alternately ruled the town. It was again under Venetian rule from 1412-1797. 
        Since then to 1918, except for the period of French occupation, it is, 
        together with the rest of Dalmatia, under Austrian rule. At the end of 
        the First World War it was occupied by Italy but it was returned to the 
        mother country under provisions of Rapal Agreement in 1920. Since 1991., 
        &#352;ibenik is part of the independent Croatian Republic.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central church in &#352;ibenik, the Cathedral of 
        St. James, lifetime work of Juraj Dalmatinac, is on the UNESCO World Heritage 
        list. Several successive architects built it completely in stone in the 
        15th and 16th centuries, both in Gothic and in Renaissance style. The 
        interlocking stone slabs of the Cathedral's roof were damaged in war in 
        1991 but the damage has since been repaired. &#352;ibenik is also surrounded 
        by 4 fortresses, three on the land (saint Mihovil, saint Ivan, fortress 
        &#8222;&#352;ubi&#263;evac&#8220;) and one on the sea (saint Nikola).<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The town of &#352;ibenik was also the first city in 
        the world who got a polyphase system of alternating current. The system 
        supplied 340 street lights and some electrified houses in the town. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this excursion you will be able to see all the historical 
        monuments, swim on one of the most beautiful beaches in Croatia (Rogoznica) 
        and see the lovely Dragon's Eye lake. The lake is considered to be a natural 
        bioreactor with intensive biochemical processes taking place there. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Extra charge for this trip is 8 &euro;.</strong>

      <p><font size="+2"><span class="linkCopy">Rafting on the river Cetina</span></font><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rafting on the river Cetina lasts 3-4 hours on a 9 
        km long route which ends in a restaurant &quot;Radmanove mlinice&quot; 
        (Radman's Mills). All you need to bring with you is a swimming suite, 
        some shoes suitable for water and dry clothes so you can change afterwards. 
        If you want to take pictures we recommend a waterproof camera. It is advisable 
        not to take valuable objects (jewelry, watches) and if you wear glasses, 
        tight them by a thin rope.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A guide is assigned to every crew. He will give you 
        all the equipment you need, which includes paddle, helmet and buoyancy 
        aid. You will be also given a quick tutorial for basic rafting skills. 
        This is a pool drop river and on the scale 1-6 it's classified as a 2-3 
        which means that the rapids are easy and medium.<br />
        This river has found it's way through fields and cliffs creating rapids, 
        waterfalls, lakes surrounded by wild vegetation and canyons. The natural 
        harmony in and around this river is still unharmed. Here you'll see nature 
        in its best: beautiful lakes, vegetation cliffs, waterfalls, caves and 
        more.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After rafting we will bring you to the lawn where you 
        can have lunch and enjoy being surrounded by beautiful nature, chill out, 
        play cards or sports.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Extra charge for this trip is 20 &euro;.</strong>

        </font></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Makarska is a small town on the Adriatic 
        coastline of Croatia, about 60 km southeast of Split and 140 km northwest 
        of Dubrovnik. It is a tourist centre, located on a horseshoe shaped bay 
        between the Biokovo mountains and the Adriatic Sea. The city is noted 
        for its palm-fringed promenade, where fashionable caf&eacute;s, bars and 
        boutiques overlook the pretty harbour where many pleasure craft are moored. 
        Adjacent to the beach are several large capacity hotels as well as a camping 
        ground.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The center of Makarska is an old town with narrow stone-paved 
        streets, a main church square where there is a flower and fruit market, 
        and a Franciscan monastery that houses a sea shell collection featuring 
        a giant clam shell. Makarska is the center of the Makarska riviera, a 
        popular tourist destination under the Biokovo mountain.<br />

      <p> <font size="+2"><span class="linkCopy">Sinj</span></font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinj is a small city 30 km north of Split. Like the 
        rest of Dalmatia, it has had a very turbulent history. In August 1715 
        the Turks attempted to retake the Sinj fortress. Although outnumbered, 
        the inhabitants of Sinj defeated the Turks after a week-long battle. The 
        defendents were convinced that the presence of the painting of Our Lady 
        help them to thwart their more powerful adversaries. The Feast of the 
        Assumption (Velika Gospa, August 15) is, therefore, especially significant 
        for the residents of Sinj and many other believers from all over the country. 
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to participate in the Mass, see the 
        castle fortress and the rest of the rich cultural heritage of this beautiful 
        city, apply for this trip. The number of seats for this excursion is not 
        limited, since we would go to Sinj via regular bus line.<br />
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no extra charge for this excursion 
        </strong>(except the cost of the regular bus tickets). <a href="images/excursions/sinj1.jpg" rel="lightbox[sinj]" title="Sinj"><img src="images/slike.jpg" width="30" height="35" align="right" border="0"  /></a>

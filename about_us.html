        Student Section of the Croatian Physical Society (SSCPS) is a non-profitable 
        organisation of Croatian students of physics and a representative of Croatia 
        in the International Association of Physics Students (IAPS) as a National 
        Commitee. It was founded in 1994 as one of the sections of the Croatian 
        Physical Society (CPS). Primary goal of the Section is to improve the 
        education of students of physics and geophysics through socialising and 
        collaboration, as well as to appropriately contribute to the development 
        of the scientific community in Croatia.</p>
      <p>Students' interests for working in Section are diverse: from simple socialising, 
        fun and traveling, to gaining experience in research and engagement in 
        improving conditions of study at our universities. The Section has about 
        130 members, mostly students of physics and geophysics, and through regular 
        contact with the Section, its alumnae (now mostly graduate students) also 
        take part in its activities. Level of involvement in Section's activities 
        is determined by the members themselves and self-initiative is always 
        appreciated.</p>
      <p>Activities of the Section are manifested in several projects, initiated 
        and run by the Section's members, project coordinators, and the overall 
        activity of the section is coordinated by the President of the Section, 
        Vice-President and the Secretary. Student section of the Croatian Physical 
        Society has very rich and diverse activities; some of the most successful 
        projects include scientific expedition to Mongolia in 1998 (for observation 
        of the meteor rain of Leonidas), editing JiAPS, an international physics 
        journal, during 1998 and 1999, organisation of the ICPS 2000 in Zadar, 
        presidency of IAPS during 2002 and 2003, visits to various research laboratories 
        in Croatia to establish stronger bonds between the students and the scientists, 
        and many other.</p>

        Croatian Physical Society (CPS) was founded on December 19, 1990 with 
        the aim of promotion and development of scientific, educational and pedagogic 
        activities in the field of physics. Prior to that date, the Croatian physicists 
        acted within the frame of the Society of the Croatian Mathematicians and 
        Physicists (founded in 1949), which developed out of the Mathematics-Physics 
        Division of the Croatian Society of Natural Sciences (founded on August 
        27, 1945).<br />
        <br />
        The activities of the Croatian Physical Society are carried out through 
        Divisions - Scientific, Educational, Students', Division for promotion 
        of Physics and Division for Industrial and Applied Physics. The Society 
        publishes scientific journals FIZIKA A and FIZIKA B, and popular magazine 
        Mathematical-Physical Journal (in cooperation with the Croatian Mathematical 
        Society) for pupils, teachers and students. Other activities of the CPS 
        include E-school of Physics, organisation of the Summer School for Young 
        Physicists, primary and high school competitions in physics (on regional 
        and national levels), as well as preparation of gifted students for participation 
        in international competitions (Physics Olympiad and Young Physicist's 
        Tournament).<br />
        <br />
        CPS is a member of European Physical Society (EPS) and the International 
        Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). The Society has about 678 members, 
        out of which about 156 are high school teachers, and 200 are students.</p>

        IAPS is an association of physics students and student societies from 
        around the globe, working to promote peaceful collaboration amongst them. 
        Its members are represented by national and local committees, who meet 
        regulary to ensure the relevance of IAPS' activities.</p>
    
      <p>Since 1987 IAPS has worked continously to promote peaceful relations 
        and collaboration between physics students. We support our members in 
        their academic and professional work, as well as discussing and acting 
        on scientific, social and cultural issues. IAPS is a recognised non-governmental 
        organisation run entirely by students from around the world with a spirit 
        of mutual understanding and equality. IAPS runs an annual International 
        Conference for Physics Students (ICPS), visits to global research institutions, 
        summer schools, exchange programmes and multinational meetings all over 
        the world.</p>
      <p>IAPS collaborates with numerous international bodies including amongst 
        others: the European Physical Society, the Institute of Physics and the 
        American Physical Society (their student wing runs a national competition 
        to sponsor their students to attend our events).</p>

        Split is the largest city on the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea; after 
        Zagreb it is the second largest city in Croatia. It is situated between 
        the gulf of Ka&#353;tela, which can be seen from the northern side of 
        Marjan, and the mountain ranges of Kozjak and Mosor. Because of the protection 
        of the high mountains, we have very mild, typical Mediterranean climate 
        here in Split. <br />
        <br />
        This area has been attractive to man for habitation ever since early prehistory. 
        The Greeks founded their first colonies in the area in the 4th century 
        BC: Tragurion (Trogir), Salonae (Solin), Epetion (Stobrec). In the period 
        of Roman domination Salonae developed into a large city. Not far from 
        Salonae, there was a small Greek settlement called Aspalathos which got 
        the name after a plant which in early spring blooms with tiny, intensive 
        yellow flowers - <em>brnistra</em>. In the Roman period it was named Spalatum. 
        The palace of the Roman emperor Diocletian was built at the bottom of 
        the southern cove of the peninsula of Split, in the period between 293 
        and 305 AD.<br />
        <br />
        Diocletian&#8217;s palace is the world&#8217;s best preserved palace from 
        the Roman period. In 1979 the historic core of Split together with the 
        Palace became a part of the UNESCO&#8217;s list of world heritage; it 
        is considered in the whole world as the key building for the understanding 
        that type of architecture. After being under Byzantine rule, Venetian 
        Republic, Napoleon, Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, as well as a part of Yugoslavia, 
        Split in now one of the most beautiful cities in Croatia, and in Europe 
        as well; the people in Split tend to call it &#8220;the most beautiful 
        city in the world&#8221;. And maybe that is not far from truth, especially 
        considering the fact that all those rulers left beautiful monumental traces 
        in the city, which are preserved to this very day. Come and see many different 
        architectural monuments all existing in harmony; come and walk along the 
        most beautiful embankment you have ever seen; come and enjoy our beautiful 
        sea!<br>

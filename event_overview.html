        <br />
        ICPS is a conference for physics students, run by physics students. It 
        is held once a year (usually in mid-August) in a different city as chosen 
        by the International Association of Physics Students (IAPS) and lasts 
        for one week. The objective of the conference is to bring physics students 
        from across the world together in a forum in which to exchange ideas and 
        experiences from within the scientific community as well as to share and 
        celebrate the cultural diversity that the field of science enjoys. The 
        conference fee includes accommodation, breakfast, lunch and most evening 
        meals as well as participation in the academic and social programmes and 
        places on the various conference excursions and tours. This year we are 
        expecting approximately 450 participants (both undergraduate and graduate) 
        from over 30 different countries.</p>
      <p>Usual activities on ICPS include:
      <ul>
        <li> delegate lectures lasting 20 minutes</li>
        <li> poster sessions</li>
        <li> guest lectures</li>
        <li> excursions to places of scientific, cultural or historical interest</li>
        <li> a guided tour of Split </li>
        <li> IAPS Annual General Meeting and workshops</li>
        <li> parties, including the welcome, farewell and national parties; at 
          the national party, delegates are encouraged to share examples of their 
          national food, drink and entertainment.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
</p>
      <img src="images/this_years_icps.gif" width="400" height="30" /> 
      <p>Here are some things we think you should know concerning this year&#8217;s 
        conference. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">FESB - Faculty of Engineering, Electric Engineering 
          and Naval Engineering</span><br />
          All of the scientific programme, student lectures and poster sessions 
          as well as the invited speakers&#8217; lectures, are hosted by FESB. 
          The FESB&#8217;s reputation has been contributed by numerous presentations 
          of research results obtained by professors and students, both at home 
          and abroad. These research results have been published in scientific 
          and professional journals, or have been reported at international scientific 
          and professional conferences. The Faculty often organises home and international 
          conferences, seminars and public lectures, and during the summer it 
          organises the physics school for secondary school students. These activities, 
          as well as a successful cooperation with economic organizations, have 
          contributed to the Faculty&#8217;s reputation. A number of FESB professors 
          have become renowned in industry, both for their teaching and research 
          work.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">Accommodation</span><br />
          Accommodation for ICPS2009 participants will be located at &quot;U&#269;eni&#269;ki 
          dom Split&quot; which is only 5 minutes away from FESB on foot and which 
          provides all the meals during the conference. It is a recently renovated 
          nine storey building with an elevator and parking. All rooms have three 
          beds and there are two (M/F) restrooms and showers on every floor. There 
          are also several hostel-type chillout rooms with TVs. A wireless internet 
          connection is available from the nearby faculties.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">Lectures and posters</span><br />
          Students from all over the world, members of IAPS, are invited to give 
          a lecture or present a poster. The topic may be the research they are 
          currently doing or something they just happen to find interesting from 
          the world of science.This year we have 99 student lectures and 57 posters. 
          Lectures should be up to 15 minutes long, with additional 5 minutes 
          for questions and discussion. Posters will be presented in two poster 
          sessions on Sunday, 16th August. All participants are encouraged to 
          vote for the best poster and best oral presentations. The winners will 
          receive valuable prizes.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">Round table</span><br />
          The round table topic is the physics studies in Europe. Chair of the 
          round table is prof. Hendrik Ferdinande, head of the EUPEN (European 
          Physics Education Network). Several rectors and vice-rectors of Croatian 
          universities and deans of several institutions are expected to speak 
          at the round table. We encourage all participants to take this opportunity 
          to state the problems they&#8217;ve stumbled upon in high-school or 
          university physics educaton and share their opinion on what changes 
          are necessary. Some of the conclusions of the round table are expected 
          to impact the shape of physics education in Croatia and Europe in the 
          near future.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">City tour</span><br />
          We will take the participants on a special tour of Split during which 
          they will see some of the oldest and best preserved archaeological sites 
          in Croatia. There will be enough free time for individual sightseeing 
          and exploration. The details of the city tour and a map will be provided 
          separately.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">Parties</span><br />
          Every evening there will be a theme party of some sort in the dormitory. 
          Some of the more traditional ICPS parties include: the Croatian evening 
          (during which you will learn something about Croatian history and culture 
          and have an opportunity to taste some of Croatian cuisine), the National 
          party (where the participants are encouraged to bring and present a 
          bit of their home) and the costume party (this is self-explanatory).<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">Excursions</span><br />
          There is much to see in Croatia, so we&#8217;ve chosen a few places 
          near Split that we believe are worth visiting: Zadar, &#352;ibenik, 
          Makarska, river Cetina and small historical towns around Split. </li>
      </ul>

      The ICPS2009 survival guide is intended to provide you with all the information 
      necessary for a relaxed and enjoyable stay in Split. Perhaps it will also 
      help you explore Croatia further than Split. Read it carefully and remember 
      there are always volunteers and members of the Organising Committee around 
      you, and you can ask for help.<br />
      <br />
      You can download the survival guide <span class="link"><a href="ICPS2009%20Survival%20guide.pdf">here</a></span>, 
      but you will also get the printed version as part of the conference materials.<br />

      <p><img src="images/how_to_get_here.gif" width="400" height="30" /></p>
      <p>This passage should help you decide how to reach Split. Should you encounter 
        any problems or have further questions, feel free to contact us on <a href="mailto:icps2009@fizika.org">icps2009@fizika.org</a>. 
        In addition to the text below, we have put together a <strong>Google Map</strong> 
        with all the information, which can be reached by clicking <a href="http://tinyurl.com/icps2009map" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>Split is one of Croatia's main travel nodes, and can be reached by plane, 
        car, bus, train and ferry. (assuming, of course, you don't want to use 
        a bike or go on foot). Whatever kind of mass-transportation you use, you 
        will reach the Split harbour. The main bus and railway stations are there 
        as well. We will have an <strong>information desk</strong> at the harbour, 
        where ICPS2009 volunteers will be ready to help you and answer any questions 
        you may have. From the harbour you can reach the dormitory (where the 
        <strong>registration desk</strong> will be located) on foot, by taxi, 
        or by bus; for more details refer to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/icps2009map" target="_blank">Google 
        map</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <span class="linkCopy">By plane</span><br />
          This is probably the most efficient and the most comfortable way to 
          travel to Split. For a list of airline operators and timetables, check 
          the <a href="http://www.split-airport.hr/Split_aerodrom_en.htm" target="_blank">website 
          of the Split airport</a>. Since the airport is several kilometers outside 
          of Split, you will need to take the bus, which will again take you to 
          the harbour. The <em>&quot;Pleso prijevoz&quot;</em> bus leaves from 
          the airport and brings you directly to the harbour (timetables can be 
          found <a href="http://www.plesoprijevoz.hr/schedulest.htm" target="_blank">here</a>). 
          The fare takes 25 minutes and costs 30 kn (about 5 &euro;).<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">By train</span><br />
          Trains to Split usually go through Zagreb, so it is most likely you 
          will have to switch trains there. Our national railway company is &quot;HZ&quot; 
          (Hrvatske Zeljeznice), and their website and timetables can be found 
          <a href="http://www.hznet.hr/" target="_blank">here</a>. For international 
          railway connections, we suggest using websites such as <a href="http://www.bahn.de" target="_blank">www.bahn.de</a> 
          or <a href="http://www.b-rail.be" target="_blank">http://www.b-rail.be</a>.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">By bus</span><br />
          Split is well connected by bus lines to Croatian and some other european 
          cities, especially during the summer tourist season. The <em>&quot;Bus 
          station Split&quot;</em> website with the timetable can be found <a href="http://www.ak-split.hr/EN/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
          If you are travelling through Zagreb, you should also check the <a href="http://www.akz.hr/En.htm" target="_blank">Zagreb 
          bus terminal website</a>.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li><span class="linkCopy">By ferry</span><br />
          Split is also directly connected to Ancona (Italy) on a daily basis, 
          and the timetables can be found <a href="http://www.jadrolinija.hr/default.aspx?lang=2" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

          Split is one of the oldest cities in Croatia, former home to emperor

        <li class="manje"><span class="link">What's the weather like in Split 
          in August? What should I wear?</span><br />
          Summer in Split... it should be very hot, with temperatures above 35&deg;C, 
          so you should have a lot of light clothes with you, UV-shielded sunglasses 
          and a hat. Also, remember to drink a lot, preferrably water :) However, 
          if there's a summer shower or thunderstorm, temperature could fall below 
          15&deg;C for a short period of time, so be prepared for that, too.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li class="manje"><span class="link">What's there to do in Split?</span><br />
          You can go a bit out of town to the beach, visit some of its restaurants, 
          clubs and cafes, or enjoy an evening in theater and one of many summer 
          culture events. Please check the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/icps2009map" target="_blank">Google

        </li>
        <li class="manje"><span class="link">What about the National party?</span><br />
          You should bring food and drinks characteristic for your country or 
          city. You don&#8217;t have to bring all fresh vegetables and bread, 
          as you will be able to buy most of that in Split. Bring the food that 
          you know you won&#8217;t find anywhere else except in your country. 
          Please, inform us in advance of all kitchen appliances you might need. 
          There are several kitchens at your disposal, but practice has shown 
          that you should focus more on snack food, with the least possible cooking. 
          Also, we encourage you to prepare your own music/dance/performance for 
          the party. Help us make this year&#8217;s National Party a party to 
          remember :)<br />

        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Population</span> (April 2001): 
          Croatia - 4,437,460; Split County - 463,676; Split: 188,694 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Territory</span>: Croatia&#8216;s 
          land territory takes up 56,542 km2. It borders with Hungary, Slovenia, 
          Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and there is a seaborder 
          with Italy. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Dalmatian coast</span>: The coast 
          is the main tourist attraction for good reason - the crystal clear waters 
          are one of the most beautiful on the planet and were just named one 
          of its most pure! 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Islands</span>: An amazing 1,246 
          islands lie off the Dalmatian coast, 47 of them are inhabited. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Climate</span>: Mediterranean 
          - this means the summer is very hot, but occasional rainshowers or thunderstorms 
          may appear.
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Local time</span>: Croatia is 
          part of the Central European Time Zone (GMT+1). When it is 12:00 in 
          Split, it is 12:00 in Berlin, 11:00 in London, 06:00 in New York, 14:00 
          in Moscow, and 21:00 in Sydney. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Calling phones</span>: To call 
          an international number using a landline, dial 00, then the country 
          code, and then the local number, omitting the leading 0. If you are 
          using your cellphone to call a number in Split, dial +385 21 xxxxxx, 
          where xxxxxx is the local number. To call the Croatian mobile networks, 
          simply replace 21 with 91, 92, 95 or 98, depending on the network. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Currency</span>: <em>kuna</em> 
          (Croatian kuna, kn or HRK) and 1/100 of a kuna is called <em>lipa</em>. 
          Croatia is not in the Euro zone, so you cannot pay in euros. Dollars, 
          pounds, etc. are not accepted as well. However, there are numerous exchange 
          offices throughout the city. Choose the ones that don&#8217;t charge 
          any comission and do not exchange all of your money at the airport, 
          since the exchange rate is better in the city. Currently the exchange 
          rate to euro fluctuates around 7.3, which means that for 100 &euro; 
          you can get approximately 730 kn. For up-to-date information check <a href="http://www.hnb.hr/tecajn/htecajn.htm" target="_blank">here</a> 
          (HRK is 1 kn) 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Power supply</span>: AC 220V 
          50Hz, so you might need an adaptor. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Taxi</span>: Taking a taxi in 
          Split is quite expensive. A ride across town costs around 70 kn (10 
          &euro;), initial price is 20 kn (around 3 &euro;). To order a taxi, 
          call 970 from local landline, or +38521970 from your own network. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Public transport</span>: There 
          are many daytime bus lines and one night line through the city. Check 
          <a href="http://www.promet-split.hr" target="_blank">this link</a> for 
          more details. Lines 15 and 18 connect the dormitory and FESB with the 
          city centre and their timetables are listed in the Survival guide. For 
          all the important bus stops, check the Google map online or the map 
          on pages 19/20 in the Guide. An individual one-way ticket you can buy 
          on any kiosk costs 10 kn (around 1.5 &euro;), and a two way ticket costs 
          16 kn. You can also buy blocks of 10 two-way tickets for 150 kn. These 
          prices are valid for travel on all lines in zone 1, which is probably 
          all you will need during ICPS. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Security</span>: You shouldn&#8217;t 
          fear of being attacked or mugged in the streets in Croatia. But, as 
          always, exercise caution: never leave your belongings unattended, avoid 
          trouble and report anything suspicious to us. We will deal with it. 
          You can find some important telephone numbers in the Survival Guide, 
          just in case you need them. Always keep your documents with you. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Health</span>: We recommend taking 
          traveler&#8217;s health insurance with you. There is an emergency station 
          within walking distance from the dormitory, for all emergency cases. 
          Regarding the recent outbreak of swine-flu: there were several cases 
          in Croatia, but there is plenty of medicine in Split's hospitals so 
          you should be safe. Report any symptoms you find suspicious. People 
          allergic to various sorts of food should ask about the food they receive 
          everywhere. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Smoking</span>: Smoking is, as 
          of this year, prohibited in all closed public spaces. This means that 
          you are allowed to smoke only in designated areas of some cafes and 
          clubs. The penalties are high, so watch out. Smoking is also prohibited 
          in the dormitory and FESB. 
        <li class="manje"><span class="linkCopy">Alcohol</span>: Alcoholic drinks 
          are, of course, not prohibited, but their abuse in public place will 
          be reported to the police. Have fun, but behave responsibly.
